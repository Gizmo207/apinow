# üß™ API Platform Testing Checklist

## Automated Tests

Run the automated test suite:

```bash
# Get your auth token first
# 1. Go to https://apinow.cloud and log in
# 2. Open DevTools > Application > Local Storage
# 3. Find your Firebase auth token
# 4. Export it:

export TEST_AUTH_TOKEN="your-token-here"

# Run tests
node test-api-platform.js
```

## Critical Issues to Check

### üö® Double `/api/api` Bug

- [ ] No "Could not load credentials" errors
- [ ] No "Unterminated string" errors
- [ ] No "permission denied" errors

### üö® Authentication
- [ ] Auth token included in same-origin requests
- [ ] Auth works on both localhost and prod
- [ ] Token refreshes before expiration
- [ ] Logout clears token

---

## Load Testing (Optional)

```bash
# Install Apache Bench
# Ubuntu: apt-get install apache2-utils
# Mac: brew install httpd

# Test endpoint (replace with your URL and token)
ab -n 100 -c 10 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
   https://apinow.cloud/api/dynamic/api_analytics
```

Expected:
- [ ] No 500 errors under load
- [ ] Average response time < 500ms
- [ ] 99th percentile < 2s

---

## Emergency Rollback Plan

If something breaks in production:

1. **Quick Fix**: Revert to previous deployment
   ```bash
   vercel rollback
   ```

2. **Check Logs**:
   - Vercel dashboard > Functions > Logs
   - Firebase console > Firestore > Usage

3. **Common Fixes**:
   - Re-add environment variable
   - Clear browser cache
   - Redeploy with `vercel --prod`
